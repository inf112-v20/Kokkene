## Task 2
### Final product
A functioning LAN-capable version of the board game RoboRally. 

The goal of our application will be a working version of the boardgame RoboRally. \
A working version however, might not be very specific. \
Therefore, you can find a list of requirements below. \
The list specifies what should be implemented, \
in order to fulfill our goal of what we consider a working application.

### High level requirements

-   Maps / Courses

-   Timer

-   Program Registers

-   Card decks
    -   Amount of cards received based on damage
  
-   Program robots

-   Damage & Destruction

-   Phase sequences in multiple rounds

## Task 3 
### Project Methodology 
For this project we have decided to use a combination of Scrum and Extreme Programming. Seeing as we are five people,
the need for a good project structure is key in achieving our deadlines. From Scrum we adopt the product backlog, a prioritized 
list of assignments for creating the intended product for the customer. Kristoffer will work as the product leader, making sure
the team prioritizes correctly and meets the deadlines assigned by the customer. We will however come to an overall agreement
on which perspectives of the project should be in todo, and work in cycle in medium length sprints.
This is where we need Extreme Programming, a planning and feedback loop. In the middle of a sprint if we meet obstacles
we are able to reconsider and review our work, adopt new customer requirement as we get to know the code and the challenges we 
face. Being strict in our timelines and still slightly flexible in which tasks to do, we think will show itself crucial as we work 
further with the code. 

Getting into specifics we are to meet twice a week for 2-3 hours, to discuss our current sprint or starting a sprint. When a sprint
is started we will work through the todo when we are able to before our next meeting. At each meeting we will present any obstacles
and get some feedback on how well along everything is going. And also if new customer requirements are needed from the backlog.
We have some divided work tasks, in accordance to each persons role in the project.

**Leader**: Kristoffer will focus on organizing meetings and making sure deadlines are met,\
and that we work on the correct tasks.

**GameCoder**: Jan Kåre will be our lead developer, making sure all the code is modular and works together well.

**TestCoder**: Markus will do quality assurance, focusing on writing tests and keeping the code high quality.

**CustomerContact**: Martin will make sure the logic is correct, in accordance to the rules of the game.

**Graphic Design**: Arthur will focus on graphics and how to visualize each scene in the game.\
While each of us will try to keep to our specialties,\
we will of course offer each other help if ones workload is bigger.

## Task 4 
### User Stories
These are our user stories which are needed for completing the first obligatory task.

**User stories for the board**

-   P1 - As a player, I want to see the board I am going to play on.
-   P2 - As a player, I want to be able to move around the board.

**User stories for the pieces**
-   P3 - As a player, I want to see my piece/s on the board so i can plan my move.\
-   P4 - As a player, I want to be able to select were to place my pieces at the start of the game.

####How do we accomplish these user stories?

**P1**
-   We need a way of visualizing the board
-   Paint on default tiles

**P2**
-   We need to be able to put down a piece somewhere on the board
-   Be able to move around according to instructions

**P3**
-   We need a visualized board
-   Paint on a player avatar

**P4**
-   We need to be able to put down a piece somewhere on the board
-   Have something that allows the player to choose the starting position.

###Summary of the 1st assignment.
**What worked**
-   The team was well organized and everyone did their share.
-   Effective meetings, where everyone that was available, took part.
-   A mix of Scrum and XP also worked very well as our project methodology of choice, as it helped organize us.

**What did not work**
-   We got a little ahead of ourselves sometimes, where we focused more on future goals.
-   Project board could also have been used more frequently
    
**Did we hit our goals?**\
Yes, Kokkene believes that we hit our goals and more.
