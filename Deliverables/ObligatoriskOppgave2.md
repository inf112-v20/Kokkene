RoboRally is a multiplayer game in which robots move around the map attempting to get to all the flags. 

###User Stories:
These are our user stories which are needed for completing the second obligatory task.


#####User story 1:
As a player I expect the walls and holes on the board to behave appropriately.
    
#####Acceptance criterias:
1. The player is not able to cross over walls.
2. Walking out of the board reboots(kills) the player.
3. Falling into holes also reboots the player.
    
#####User story 2:
As I player I want to be able to know my health and objective.
    
#####Acceptance criterias:
1. Show the health of the robot as an overlay
2. Make the objective more obvious (display which flag to move to).

#####User story 3:
As I player I want to be able to get a hand of cards.
    
#####Acceptance criterias:
1. Create a card element.
1. Give "cards" and give it to the player.

###Project and Project-Structure

#####Roles
We feel that the assigned roles could have been utilized more properly.
This was fortunately the idea we had going into this, because everyone wanted to try a bit of everything.
Even so we feel that the roles we got suited us.
The only thing is that we might have to prioritize having one more test coder.

#####Kristoffer: Teamleader
I feel like this role suits me because i am not afraid to speak up when something is wrong or needs fixing.\
I very much enjoy speaking in-front of people and have some control over what is happening.\
My experience with this role so far is that it is more about being a part of every role of the team more so than controlling them.\
People often like to do things their way, and im not going to tell them to do something else if it works fine.

#####Martin: Customer contact
I enjoy the work from idea to product, I therefore felt like I could make an impact\
in this role. I am very engaged in the boardgame and enjoy formulating the rules into\
real code. That is why I chose this role, and so far I am happy with it.

#####Jan KÃ¥re: Code leader

#####Arthur: Artistic leader
When it comes to making a game, the visual part of it is by far one of the most important parts of it.\
Therefore I felt it was natural for me to work with the visual parts of this project.\
I feel comfortable with working with sound and photo editing.\
At the same time I work with the game Art, I also get to write a lot of code.

#####Markus: Test leader
As a test leader, I quality check tests and change them if needed.\
Going into this role, \
I had as little experience with testing as everyone else on the group,\
but seeing how integral testing is, I wanted to learn more about it.\
The role doesn't feel too demanding either,\
so it has let me focus on writing and refactoring code.

#####Methodology
The group feels like we hit the spot on our methodology.\
We decided to go with the "Scrum" methodology since everyone is comfortable working alone and as a team.\
There are some risks involved with scrum, however we feel like the positives outweigh the negatives.
We have group session's twice a week where we arrange sprints, such that everyone can come with ideas and ask for help with coding. 

#####Communication
Everyone on the group have created a "Slack" account and post updates on our slack workspace when something is edited.\
We have all grown quite accustomed to each-other at this point, and no one is afraid to ask questions when we meet up.\
No arguments or disagreements have broken out and probably never will.\
Only negative is that we post a little bit infrequent on "Slack".

#####Retrospection
The group feel's like we hit our goals and are quite good at setting reasonable ones.\
Every deadline we have set has been met so far and everyone are contributing in some way shape and form.\
Everyone is happy with the current twice a week meetings schedule.\
The project-board we think might be a bit under utilized, and we will work on improving this in the future.
