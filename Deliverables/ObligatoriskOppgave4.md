## RoboRally - a game made by Kokkene
RoboRally is a multiplayer game in which robots move around the map attempting to get to all the flags. 

## Team and Project
As a team I think we hit the mark pretty good with our roles selection and philosophy.\
We picked the roles we wanted ourselves and felt most comfortable with.\
This is probably one of the reasons we do not feel the need to change up the different roles.\
We discussed the possibility of reassigning Kristoffer, as we felt like the team lead role\
was not the most necessary for our team-methodology. Ultimately we choose to stick with the current\
roles as these have been working great for us.

####Team roles:
##### Kristoffer Kraft Johansen
Role: Team leader  
Main tasks: Ensure that the task is completed in the given time frames. Making sure communication between\
the group members is good. Updating the project board and arranging group meetings.

##### Martin Johnsen
Role: Customer Contact  
Main tasks: Take care of all enquiries regarding the project. Making sure the project is up to our set requirements.\
Updating the README.md file with useful information, and providing a UML diagram for the project.

##### Markus Jensen 
Role: Head of testing  
Main tasks: Creating useful tests that helps the developers understand, and future proof the code.\
General upkeep of the code and adding helpful comments in the code.

##### Jan Kåre Sandblåst
Role: Coding director  
Main tasks: Focus on creating useful and easy to implement code. Creating the mainframe/skeleton of our code,\
while also having the ability to help other team-members understand it. 

##### Arthur Andersen 
Role: Lead designer  
Main tasks: Learning how to use Tiled and implementing maps from tiled into the game. Creating the different\
textures we need. In general thinking about improving the experience for a real player.

#### Project Methodology
Our project methodology has been the same throughout the project, with little changes.\
We feel that we chose correct early on and did quick revisions of our methodology when needed.\
To summarize how our methodology have evolved; Firstly we started out with Scrum and XP,\
doing 1 week sprint intervals of what we had on our project board. From that we noticed a\
need of a quick revision cycle, such that we could easily identify new needs the customer had, or problems.\
Secondly we made the sprints into 3/4 days cycles. Such that we had a much more even feedback loop.\
This corresponded well with the meetings we set up, and we personally feel that we got a good development structure.

#### Retrospection

#### Communication
The communication in the group works really well, we use slack and github project board\
to inform each other of updates we have made. We also meet twice a week\
for 2 hours on Discord, this is where most of the work is done.\
This way of communicating works well with our group.
