## RoboRally - a game made by Kokkene
RoboRally is a multiplayer game in which robots move around the map attempting to get to all the flags. 

#### Project Methodology
Our project methodology has been the same throughout the project, with little changes.\
We feel that we chose correct early on and did quick revisions of our methodology when needed.\
To summarize how our methodology have evolved; Firstly we started out with Scrum and XP,\
doing 1 week sprint intervals of what we had on our project board. From that we noticed a\
need of a quick revision cycle, such that we could easily identify new needs the customer had, or problems.\
Secondly we made the sprints into 3/4 days cycles. Such that we had a much more even feedback loop.\
This corresponded well with the meetings we set up, and we personally feel that we got a good development structure.

#### Communication
The communication in the group works really well, we use slack and github project board\
to inform each other of updates we have made. We also meet twice a week\
for 2 hours on Discord, this is where most of the work is done.\
This way of communicating works well with our group.

#### User Stories

1.  As a player, I want someone to play with.

2.  As a developer, I want good commit messages, such that i can easily see what was edited.

3.  As a player, I want the implemented features to be bug-free. 

#### Acceptance Criterias

1.  Have a simple computer that plays some cards.

2.  The message contains all noteworthy changes, and documents them properly.

3.  All implemented features which the player can interact with, should work accordingly, and without game-breaking bugs.

##### Implementation
TODO
1.  Create a non-player object that does some legal moves.
        
2.  Make the team agree on/ or create a suitable template for git commits.

3.  Features which have been remodeled/fixed
