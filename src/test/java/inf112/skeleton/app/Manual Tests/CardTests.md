## Selecting cards (info)
Selecting cards is done with the mouse.\
Upon clicking a card, it should indicate it has been chosen by turning green and having a number on it.\
The number represents which turn the card will be played in.

When you have selected 5 cards, the only way to do anything with the 5 cards should be either,\
clicking the confirm button on the screen, or use the keyboard shortcuts 'c'.\
'c' should confirm the cards, and move the player accordingly. You can toggle them on and off.

If damage is taken, then a card will be removed from the hand.\
However, no matter how much damage has been taken, you will always have 5 cards on hand.\
Taking damage when you only have 5 cards on hand, leads to cards starting to be locked in place.
