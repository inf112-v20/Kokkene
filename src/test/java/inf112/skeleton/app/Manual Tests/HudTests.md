# Manual tests for the Hud
This is some tests to check if the Hud is working as intended.

## Taking damage removes a heart
Walk up to the laser using the arrow keys, and use som "turn" cards\
such that the player takes some damage. Look up to the top right corner\
and take a look at the amount of hearts. It should be less than 9.

## Displaying the held cards
Start a new game with any amount of cpu players. Take a look at the bottom\
of your screen. There should be cards displayed with priority, type and move.

## Displaying other CPU's health bars
Start a new game on a map that supports more than one player. When the game\
has started it should display all the health bar's at the top right of your screen.\
The CPU's health bars should function exactly like yours. So try to shoot them\
using your arrow keys.
